# goChat
A study project to explore the possibilities around TCP/IP communication within GoLang. It is a very simple chat application that allows multiple clients to connect to a server, join chat rooms and send messages to each other.

## Where the idea came from?
This project is entirely based on the [amazing tutorial produced by 'package main'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sphme0BqJiY)

## Future work?
Currently planning to create a client application with [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) to ease the use of the chat application.
Furthermore, I would like to make a text based game of some kind (maybe an multiplayer ascii...).
